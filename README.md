# Machine_Learning_in_Business
## *This was a Machine Learning in Business project for TripleTen. 👩🏽‍💻*
This project leveraged machine learning and bootstrapping to identify an optimal region among three options for fictional energy company OilyGiant’s expansion, focusing on maximizing profit and minimizing risk. Using a linear regression model and a dataset of 100,000 data points, Region 2 emerged as the best choice, with an average potential profit exceeding $4 million, a 95% confidence interval predicting positive returns, and only a 1.8% risk of loss. These findings provide a data-driven framework for OilyGiant to allocate resources effectively and maximize profitability.
